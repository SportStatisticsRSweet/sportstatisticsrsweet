### Hi there 👋

My name is Alice Sweeting and I currently work as a researcher at [Victoria University](https://www.vu.edu.au/) in Melbourne, Australia.

 😄 Pronouns: she/ her <br>
 👩‍💻 My research focuses on the analysis of team-sport performance, typically captured via wearable sensors, using data mining techniques. <br>
 🔭 I’m currently working on creating content for and teaching into our new [Graduate Certificate in Data Analytics for Sport Performance](https://bit.ly/VUGradCertSportData) which is a formal short-course qualification in data science with a unique sports context. <br>
 🌱 I’m currently learning how to advance my Shiny knowledge. <br>
 💬 Ask me about anything sport science/ analytics and #RStats! <br>
 📫 You can reach me via email [here](mailto:Alice.Sweeting@vu.edu.au) <br>
 ⚡ Fun fact: I grew up riding horses, living and breathing all things 🐎 My life goal(s) were to be an equine vet and compete for Australia in the 3DE at the Olympics!
